# Bayesian Modeling Workshop: Building Statistical Models,
  Understanding When To Use Bayesian Inference


Bayesian modeling workshop at MIT SSAC 2024. March 2, 2024


Abstract:

Bayesian inference is used a lot in sports analytics. This is a
practical, hands-on workshop for people wanting to spend an hour
working with data and iterating over statistical models. If you're
interested in how to work with sports data, have already worked with a
few models and want to understand how to interpret the results, or
have questions about reparametrization for MCMC efficiency, please
join! We'll estimate the parameters of a simple model using Bayesian
and frequentist techniques, discuss the differences, then move on to a
hierarchical model that requires Bayesian inference to fit.

The example will most likely be an adjusted plus minus model applied
to NBA data.

This workshop will use Stan (https://mc-stan.org), a statistical
modeling language, for the model building; feel free to use Python or
R for data manipulation and processing.
